# quizchallange

For this week's challange we were asked to create a Javascript quiz using the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JS. 
The first thing I procedeed to do was to start with the HTML focusing on the structure. Then I proceeded to focus on styling the webpage giving
it a few properties on CSS and then once the backbone was set and ready then I proceeded with the Javascript. The most challanging part was setting the timer correctly and making sure the highscores were loged. 
Once the completed application was launched the browser first shows two things the start button and the highscores. After clicking on the start button the timer starts from 100 and if the timer hits 0 before you have answered all ten questions the quiz will automatically end. If you click on a right or wrong answer you can see the right answer turns green and the rest of the buttons turn red. Once you have completed the quiz at the end you will see your score ranging from 1-100%, Then you can proceed by leaving your initials and once the page is refreshed you can click on the highscore div and you will the the highscores last logged on the screen.
